# TicTacToe

This is a simple TicTacToe game based in Linux console. As of 6th of December 2016, there is no AI in place. My development plan goes as follows:
1. Prepare AI version for shipment.
2. Integrate new menu, which will include settings tab and ability for players to chose whether they would like to play versus human or a computer. 

At one point this game will be migrated to graphical interface. The game currently supports polish language. Sorry for inconvience.
